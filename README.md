# Welcome to NVIDIA Holoscan Federated Analytics!

This is a repository for all the resources related to Holoscan Federated Analytics.

Federated Analytics is an approach to user data analytics that combines information from distributed datasets without gathering it at a central location.

[NVIDIA Holoscan](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/clara/holoscan/) is normally deployed on a fleet of IGX devices. A goal of Holoscan Federated Analytics is to provide Holoscan customers a feature where Holoscan customers can capture and analyze specific metrics for Holoscan applications deployed on a fleet of IGX devices. This will be demonstrated with a sample end-to-end Holoscan federated analytics application.

The Holoscan Federate Analytics is using [NVIDIA FLARE](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare). NVIDIA FLARE supports federated statistics where FLARE provides built-in federated statistics operators (controller and executors) that can generate global statistics based on local client side statistics.
